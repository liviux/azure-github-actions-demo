### How to use AI from OpenAI to solve some DevOps problems.  
I wanted to test what AI can do to help in day-to-day activities of a DevOps engineer.   
So the first thing was to find what to do. I found a job interview task and its requirements were this ones:  

> Use a free account on Azure and GitHub and implement a basic deployment pipeline using GitHub actions to create an Azure resource group and provision a Web App, a SQL Database, one AutoScale settings, at least one Alert rules, and monitoring (App Insights). Web App backend must be able to use that SQL database. Deploy a simple Web App to this infrastructure from the pipeline (can be just a static html page)

As the task is pretty imprecise I modified it. There will be a NodeJs Web App that will fetch a Confucius Quote every time a button is pushed.  
   
I used ChatGPT (both with **GPT4** and **GPT 3.5**) and Bing AI Chat (both **Precise** and **Creative** modes). ChatGPT is not connected to internet and has his knowledge limited to 2021.
Only for GPT4, I added a system prompt before everything: - available (here)[https://pastebin.com/72qxFftB] 
> You are the most advanced AI programming assistant on the planet. 
>- You write extensive comments for every line of code you create. 
>- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
>- Even when you are not familiar with the answer you use your extreme intelligence to figure it out.
>- Then output the code in a single code block.
>Wait for my instructions.

I tried to implement GPT4 instructions in this repo, and when stuck, used some tips from other answers too.

Now the steps and every answer:  

## 1.  
I need to implement a basic pipeline using GitHub Actions and Azure. 
Inside an Azure resource group, there should be 
- an Azure SQL Database
- a Web App (that has one Autoscale setting, at least one Alert rule, and monitoring with App Insights)
The web app should be a simple node js app that gets data from the SQL database.  
There should be a front end and a back end part on my GitHub repo.  
I don't want to add an API part. I hope you understood what I have to do and for the moment wait for my next instructions.

<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT4</summary>
I understand the requirements. Let's start by breaking down the tasks into detailed pseudocode.
Set up an Azure Resource Group: a. Create an Azure SQL Database. b. Create a Web App with Autoscale settings, Alert rules, and App Insights.
Develop a simple Node.js web app that connects to the Azure SQL Database: a. Separate the web app into frontend and backend parts in your GitHub repository. b. Implement frontend code to make requests to the backend. c. Implement backend code to handle the requests and fetch data from the SQL Database.
Implement a basic pipeline using GitHub Actions and Azure: a. Create a YAML file for the GitHub Actions workflow in your repository. b. Configure the workflow to build, test, and deploy the Node.js web app to Azure.
Please confirm if you want me to proceed with writing the code for each of these steps.
</details>
<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT3.5</summary>
Yes, I understand the requirements. Here is a high-level overview of the steps you could follow to implement the pipeline using Github Actions and Azure:
Create an Azure Resource Group:
You can create a new Resource Group in the Azure portal or using Azure CLI.
Make sure you set the region to the one closest to your users.
Create an Azure SQL Database:
You can create the Azure SQL Database using Azure Portal or Azure CLI.
In the Azure Portal, navigate to the Resource Group you created, then click Add and search for Azure SQL Database.
Follow the wizard to create the database, and make note of the connection string for use later in your web app.
Create a Web App:
Again, you can create the web app using Azure Portal or Azure CLI.
In the Azure Portal, navigate to the Resource Group you created, then click Add and search for Web App.
Follow the wizard to create the web app.
Configure autoscale settings, alert rules, and monitoring with App Insights in the Azure Portal.
Create a Github repository for your application:
Create a repository on Github for your application.
Add the front-end and back-end code to the repository.
Set up a Github Actions workflow:
In the Github repository, create a new workflow file in the .github/workflows directory.
Use the Azure Login action to authenticate with Azure. You will need to create a service principal for this purpose.
Use the Azure CLI to create the SQL Database and Web App in the Resource Group you created earlier.
Use the Azure Web App action to deploy your web app to Azure.
Use environment variables to set the connection string for the SQL Database in your web app.
Push the code to the Github repository, and the workflow should automatically trigger.
That should be enough to get you started. Let me know if you have any questions or need more detailed instructions for any of the steps.

Sure! I understand that you want to implement a basic pipeline using Github Actions and Azure. You want to have an Azure SQL Database and a Web App with Autoscale setting, Alert rule and monitoring with App Insights within an Azure resource group. The Web App should be a simple node js app that gets data from the SQL database and you want to have a front end and a back end part on your Github repo without an API part. Is that correct?

<summary>Bing AI Chat - Creative</summary>
Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with some information and suggestions on how to implement a basic pipeline using Github Actions and Azure.üòä

According to the web search results¬π¬≤¬≥, you can use Github Actions to automate your software development workflows from within Github, and trigger Azure Pipelines runs from within a Github action. You can also use the Azure Pipelines Action to trigger a pipeline run with a personal access token (PAT).

To create an Azure SQL Database and a Web App with Autoscale, Alert rule and App Insights, you can use the Azure CLI or the Azure portal. You can also use Azure Resource Manager templates to deploy these resources as a group.

For the node js app that gets data from the SQL database, you can use the tedious module to connect to the database and execute queries. You can also use Express to create a web server and handle requests.

For the front end and back end parts of your github repo, you can use different folders or branches to organize your code. You can also use npm scripts to run different tasks for each part.

I hope this information is helpful for you. If you need more details or assistance, please let me know.üëç

## 2.  

The following are the steps you will take to help me with my project. I wrote them now just so you will understand what we have to do. Do not take any action for now:

From now on, every code block should have comments. First, create the file structure I will need for this project.

Now create only the HTML and CSS files. I'll add them in a GitHub repo. The front-end and back-end will be created later.
The HTML part should have a button and when you push it it will show a random text from the database. The main title would be "Confucius Quotes". Below write about what this project does in Chinese.
The style should be a very beautiful one, with a Chinese vibe.

Next, create the front-end part. I want something simple.

For the next step make me the back end part. I want something simple.

Now guide me step-by-step me how to create an Azure resource group only. Everything from now on should be done in Azure portal.

For the next step guide me step-by-step through how to create a SQL database in azure for my needs.  

And now how to easily populate this database with at least 15 Confucius quotes

Do I have to modify any file from above after I did the SQL database?

Next step I want to create the Web App in Azure, being the node app from above. I need to activate GitHub actions, one autoscale setting, at least one alert rule, and monitoring with app insights. Please answer me in detail about what I have to do.

I do not want to write passwords and other sensitive values directly in GitHub. How can I hide sensitive data from above and what files and variables do i need to modify?

Did I complete all my requirements? Is there anything else to do or is the project done?
<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT4</summary>
I understand the project requirements and the order in which you want me to proceed. 
</details>
<details>

## 3.  
From now on, every code block should have comments. First, create the file structure I will need for this project.

<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT4</summary>
Here's the file structure for your project with comments:

```
project/                                # Root folder for the entire project
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ frontend/                            # Frontend folder
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ index.html                       # Main HTML file
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ styles.css                       # Main CSS file for styling
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ backend/                             # Backend folder
    ‚îú‚îÄ app.js                           # Main Node.js server file
    ‚îú‚îÄ package.json                     # Project dependencies and metadata
    ‚îî‚îÄ database/                        # Database-related code
        ‚îî‚îÄ databaseConnection.js        # Code for connecting to the SQL database
```


</details>
<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT3.5</summary>
Sure, here's an example file structure you could use for this project:

```
project/
|-- backend/
|   |-- app.js       # main application file
|   |-- package.json # dependencies and project details
|   |-- routes.js    # routes for the API
|   |-- utils.js     # helper functions
|-- frontend/
|   |-- index.html   # HTML file for the front-end
|   |-- style.css    # CSS file for styling the HTML
|   |-- main.js      # JavaScript file for handling API requests and rendering quotes
|-- .gitignore        # list of files and directories to ignore in Git
|-- README.md         # documentation for the project
|-- LICENSE           # license information for the project
  ```
This file structure separates the front-end and back-end code into separate folders, with the main application file and routes defined in the backend folder, and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the front-end defined in the frontend folder.

The .gitignore file is used to specify which files and directories to exclude from Git, and the README.md file is used to provide documentation for the project. Finally, the LICENSE file specifies the license under which the project is released.

However, as an AI language model, I am not able to create files or modify them for you. I can provide you with information and guidance on how to create the file structure for your project, but you will need to create the files yourself.

Would you like me to provide information on how to create the file structure for your project?


</details>
<details>
<summary>Bing AI Chat - Creative</summary>
Okay, I will try to help you with the first step. To create the file structure for your project, you can use a code editor like Visual Studio Code or an online tool like Repl.it. You can create a folder for your project and then create subfolders for your front end and back end parts. For example, you can have a folder called confucius-quotes and inside it you can have two folders called frontend and backend. Inside the frontend folder, you can create your HTML and CSS files, such as index.html and style.css. Inside the backend folder, you can create your node js files, such as app.js and db.js. You can also create a package.json file to manage your dependencies and scripts. Here is an example of how your file structure could look like:

```
confucius-quotes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

These files create a simple web page with a Chinese-inspired design. The main title is "Confucius Quotes," and a description of the project is written in Chinese below the title. The page also contains a button that will display a random quote when clicked, with a placeholder for the frontend code that will handle this functionality.

Sure, here's an example HTML and CSS file you could use for the front-end:

index.html:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

This HTML file has a button with the ID quote-button that, when clicked, will display a quote from the database. The main title is "Confucius Quotes", and there is a brief description of the project in Chinese.

The CSS file is used to style the HTML with a Chinese vibe. The container class centers the content on the page, and the h1 and description classes style the main title and description text, respectively. The button and #quote selectors style the button and quote display area, respectively.

Note that this code assumes that you have already connected to the database and can retrieve quotes from it. The back-end code will need to be written to handle this functionality.




</details>
<details>
<summary>Bing AI Chat - Precise</summary>
I understand that you want to create HTML and CSS files for your project and add them to a GitHub repository. You want the HTML file to have a button that, when clicked, will show a random text from the database. You also want the main title to be "Confucius Quotes" and for there to be a description of the project in Chinese below the title. Additionally, you want the style to be beautiful with a Chinese vibe.

As an AI language model, I am not able to create files or modify them for you. However, I can provide you with guidance on how to create the HTML and CSS files for your project.

To create the HTML file, you can start by creating a new file with the `.html` extension in your `src` folder. Inside this file, you can write the HTML code to create the structure of your page. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Confucius Quotes</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Confucius Quotes</h1>
    <p>Ëøô‰∏™È°πÁõÆÊòØÂÖ≥‰∫éÂ≠îÂ≠êÂêçË®ÄÁöÑ</p>
    <button>Show Quote</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

This code creates a basic HTML page with a title, a heading, a paragraph in Chinese describing the project, and a button.

To create the CSS file, you can create a new file with the `.css` extension in your `src` folder. Inside this file, you can write CSS code to style your page. For example:

```css
body {
  font-family: "Noto Serif SC", serif;
}

h1 {
  color: #8B4513;
}

button {
  background-color: #F0E68C;
  color: #8B4513;
  border: none;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #FFD700;
}
```

This code styles the page with a Chinese font for the body text, changes the color of the heading and button text to a dark brown color, and styles the button with a light yellow background color and padding. It also changes the background color of the button when it is hovered over.

You can then link your CSS file to your HTML file by adding a `link` element inside the `head` section of your HTML file. For example:

```html
<head>
  <title>Confucius Quotes</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

This assumes that your CSS file is named `styles.css` and is located in the same folder as your HTML file.

Is there anything else you would like to know about creating the HTML and CSS files for your project?
</details>
<details>
<summary>Bing AI Chat - Creative</summary>
Okay, I will try to help you with the second step. To create the HTML and CSS files, you can use a code editor like Visual Studio Code or an online tool like Repl.it. You can write your HTML code inside the index.html file and your CSS code inside the style.css file. You can link the CSS file to the HTML file using the <link> tag in the <head> section. For example, you can have something like this:

```
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```

To create a button that shows a random text from the database, you will need some JavaScript code as well. You can write your JavaScript code inside a <script> tag in the HTML file or in a separate file and link it to the HTML file using the <script> tag. For example, you can have something like this:

```
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
```

To create the main title and the description in Chinese, you can use the <h1> and <p> tags in the HTML file. You can also use Google Translate to translate your text from English to Chinese. For example, you can have something like this:

```
<body>
  <h1>Â≠îÂ≠êËØ≠ÂΩï</h1>
  <p>Ëøô‰∏™È°πÁõÆÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™ÁÆÄÂçïÁöÑÁΩëÈ°µÂ∫îÁî®ÔºåÂÆÉÂèØ‰ª•‰ªéÊï∞ÊçÆÂ∫ì‰∏≠ÈöèÊú∫ÊòæÁ§∫‰∏ÄÊù°Â≠îÂ≠êÁöÑÂêçË®Ä„ÄÇ</p>
  <button id="quote-button">ÊòæÁ§∫‰∏ÄÊù°ËØ≠ÂΩï</button>
  <div id="quote-container"></div>
</body>
```

To style your HTML elements, you can use CSS properties and selectors in the style.css file. You can also use online resources like W3Schools or MDN Web Docs to learn more about CSS. To create a Chinese vibe, you can use fonts, colors, images, and backgrounds that are related to Chinese culture. For example, you can have something like this:

```
body {
  font-family: "Noto Sans SC", sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  background-image: url("chinese-pattern.jpg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
}

h1 {
  color: #ff0000;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  color: #000000;
  text-align: center;
}

button {
  display: block;
  margin: 20px auto;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 10px;
  background-color: #ff0000;
  color: #ffffff;
}

#quote-container {
  display: block;
  margin: 20px auto;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 2px solid #ff0000;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

I hope this helps you with the second step. If you need more assistance, please let me know.üëç

I'll add simple frontend JavaScript code to the index.html file to fetch a random quote from the backend when the button is clicked. Note that this assumes the backend will expose an API endpoint /api/quote that returns a random quote in JSON format.

Update the index.html file by adding the following JavaScript code inside the <script> tag:

```
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const quoteDisplay = document.getElementById('quoteDisplay');
    const getQuoteButton = document.getElementById('getQuote');

    getQuoteButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
        try {
            const response = await fetch('/api/quote');
            const data = await response.json();

            quoteDisplay.innerText = data.quote;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error fetching quote:', error);
            quoteDisplay.innerText = 'Error fetching quote. Please try again later.';
        }
    });
});
  ```
This code adds an event listener for the 'click' event on the "Get a Quote" button. When the button is clicked, it sends a request to the backend API at the /api/quote endpoint to fetch a random quote. Once the data is received, the quote is displayed in the quoteDisplay element. If there's an error, a message will be displayed instead.

<summary>ChatGPT - GPT3.5</summary>
Sure, here's an example main.js file you could use for the front-end:

main.js:

```
// Define a function to fetch a random quote from the API
async function getRandomQuote() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/quotes/random');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.quote;
}

// Define a function to display the quote on the page
function displayQuote(quote) {
    const quoteElement = document.getElementById('quote');
    quoteElement.innerText = `"${quote}"`;
}

// Attach a click event listener to the button
const button = document.getElementById('quote-button');
button.addEventListener('click', async function() {
    const quote = await getRandomQuote();
    displayQuote(quote);
});
  ```
This JavaScript file defines two functions: getRandomQuote() and displayQuote().

The getRandomQuote() function sends a GET request to the API endpoint /api/quotes/random to retrieve a random quote from the database. It then parses the response data as JSON and returns the quote.

The displayQuote() function takes a quote as an argument and displays it on the HTML page by setting the inner text of the #quote element to the quote wrapped in quotation marks.

Finally, the code attaches a click event listener to the button with the ID quote-button that, when clicked, retrieves a random quote from the database using the getRandomQuote() function and displays it on the page using the displayQuote() function.

To create the front-end part of your project, you can use JavaScript to add interactivity to your page. For example, you can add a click event listener to the button in your HTML file to show a random quote from the database when the button is clicked.

You can create a new file with the `.js` extension in your `src` folder to write your JavaScript code. Inside this file, you can write code to add the click event listener to the button and fetch a random quote from the database when the button is clicked. For example:

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector('button');

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // fetch a random quote from the database
  // and display it on the page
});
```

This code selects the button element on the page using the `document.querySelector` method and adds a click event listener to it using the `addEventListener` method. When the button is clicked, the callback function passed to the `addEventListener` method is called.

Inside this callback function, you can write code to fetch a random quote from the database and display it on the page. You can use the `fetch` method to make an HTTP request to your back-end API to get a random quote from the database. Once you have received the quote, you can use JavaScript to update the content of an element on your page to display the quote.

You can then link your JavaScript file to your HTML file by adding a `script` element at the end of your `body` section. For example:

```html
<body>
  ...
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
```

This assumes that your JavaScript file is named `app.js` and is located in the same folder as your HTML file.

Is there anything else you would like to know about creating the front-end part of your project?

Okay, I will try to help you with the third step. To create the front-end part, you can use JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to your web page. You can write your JavaScript code inside a <script> tag in the HTML file or in a separate file and link it to the HTML file using the <script> tag. For example, you can have something like this:

```
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
```

To make the button show a random text from the database, you will need to use some JavaScript features such as variables, functions, events, and fetch. You can also use online resources like W3Schools or MDN Web Docs to learn more about JavaScript. For example, you can have something like this:

```
// Get the button element by its id
var button = document.getElementById("quote-button");

// Get the quote container element by its id
var container = document.getElementById("quote-container");

// Define a function that fetches a random quote from the database
function getQuote() {
  // Use the fetch API to make a request to the backend server
  fetch("/quote")
    // Convert the response to JSON format
    .then((response) => response.json())
    // Display the quote in the container
    .then((data) => {
      container.innerHTML = data.quote;
    })
    // Handle any errors
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      container.innerHTML = "Something went wrong.";
    });
}

// Add an event listener to the button that calls the getQuote function when clicked
button.addEventListener("click", getQuote);
```

I hope this helps you with the third step. If you need more assistance, please let me know.üëç

For the next step make me the back end part. I want something simple.

<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT4</summary>
Here's a simple backend setup using Node.js and Express. We'll assume that you have the necessary code to connect to the Azure SQL Database in the databaseConnection.js file.

First, create a package.json file in the backend folder to manage dependencies:

```
{
  "name": "confucius-quotes-backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple backend for the Confucius Quotes project",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mssql": "^7.2.1"
  }
}
  ```
Next, create the app.js file in the backend folder:

```
// Import required modules
const express = require('express');
const { getRandomQuote } = require('./database/databaseConnection');

// Initialize the Express app
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Define the API endpoint to get a random quote
app.get('/api/quote', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const quote = await getRandomQuote();
        res.json({ quote });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching quote:', error);
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error fetching quote' });
    }
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
  ```
Finally, create the databaseConnection.js file in the backend/database folder. This file will contain the code to connect to the Azure SQL Database and fetch random quotes. Replace the placeholders with your actual Azure SQL Database connection details:

```
const sql = require('mssql');

// Configure the database connection
const config = {
    user: 'your_database_user',
    password: 'your_database_password',
    server: 'your_database_server',
    database: 'your_database_name',
    options: {
        encrypt: true,
        enableArithAbort: true
    }
};

// Connect to the database
const poolPromise = new sql.ConnectionPool(config)
    .connect()
    .then(pool => {
        console.log('Connected to the database');
        return pool;
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error connecting to the database:', error));

// Function to get a random quote from the database
async function getRandomQuote() {
    try {
        const pool = await poolPromise;
        const result = await pool.request().query('SELECT TOP 1 * FROM Quotes ORDER BY NEWID()');
        return result.recordset[0].Text;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching random quote:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}

module.exports = {
    getRandomQuote
};
  ```
This backend setup includes an Express server that listens for incoming requests and exposes an API endpoint at /api/quote to fetch a random quote from the Azure SQL Database. The databaseConnection.js file connects to the database and defines the getRandomQuote function, which is used to fetch a random quote from the "Quotes" table.

To install the dependencies and run the server, use the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```


</details>
<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT3.5</summary>
Sure, here's an example app.js file you could use for the back-end:

app.js:

```
const express = require('express');
const mssql = require('mssql');
const { getRandomInt } = require('./utils');

const app = express();

// Define a route for retrieving a random quote
app.get('/api/quotes/random', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Set up a connection pool to the database
        const pool = await mssql.connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

        // Query the database for a random quote
        const result = await pool.request().query('SELECT TOP 1 * FROM quotes ORDER BY NEWID()');
        const quote = result.recordset[0].text;

        // Send the quote as a response
        res.json({ quote });
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while retrieving the quote' });
    }
});

// Start the server
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
  ```
This back-end code defines a single route for retrieving a random quote from the database. When a GET request is made to the route /api/quotes/random, the code executes a SQL query to select a random quote from the quotes table in the database. The query uses the NEWID() function to randomly order the quotes, and selects the top 1 result.

Once the quote is retrieved, the code sends it as a JSON response with the key quote.

Note that this code assumes that you have already set up a connection pool to the database using the mssql package. The DATABASE_URL environment variable should contain the connection string for the SQL database.

The utils.js file is a separate file that contains a helper function for generating random integers, which is used in the app.js file. Here's an example utils.js file:

utils.js:

```
// Define a function to generate a random integer between min and max (inclusive)
function getRandomInt(min, max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}

module.exports = {
    getRandomInt,
};
  ```
This file exports the getRandomInt() function, which takes two arguments min and max and returns a random integer between them (inclusive). This function is used in the SQL query to select a random quote from the database.

To create the back-end part of your project, you can use Node.js and a web framework such as Express to create a simple API that can fetch data from your Azure SQL database and return it to your front-end.

You can start by installing Node.js and Express on your local machine. Once you have installed these tools, you can create a new file with the `.js` extension in your `src` folder to write your back-end code. Inside this file, you can write code to create an Express app and define routes to handle API requests from your front-end. For example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/quote', (req, res) => {
  // fetch a random quote from the database
  // and return it as a JSON response
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

This code creates an Express app and defines a route to handle `GET` requests to the `/quote` endpoint. When a request is received at this endpoint, the callback function passed to the `app.get` method is called.

Inside this callback function, you can write code to fetch a random quote from your Azure SQL database and return it as a JSON response using the `res.json` method.

You can then start your back-end server by running the `node` command followed by the name of your back-end file. For example:

```
node server.js
```

This assumes that your back-end file is named `server.js` and is located in your `src` folder.

You can write your Node.js code inside the app.js file in the backend folder. You can also use npm to install and manage packages that you need for your back-end.

For example, you can have something like this:

```
// Import the Express module
var express = require("express");

// Import the tedious module
var tedious = require("tedious");

// Create an Express application
var app = express();

// Define the port number for the server
var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Define the connection configuration for the SQL database
var config = {
  server: "your_server_name.database.windows.net",
  authentication: {
    type: "default",
    options: {
      userName: "your_user_name",
      password: "your_password",
    },
  },
  options: {
    database: "your_database_name",
    encrypt: true,
  },
};

// Create a connection object using the configuration
var connection = new tedious.Connection(config);

// Define a function that executes a query on the database and returns a random quote
function getQuote(callback) {
  // Create a request object with the query
  var request = new tedious.Request(
    "SELECT TOP 1 quote FROM quotes ORDER BY NEWID()",
    function (err, rowCount) {
      // Handle any errors
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        callback(err);
      }
    }
  );

  // Define a variable to store the quote
  var quote = "";

  // Add an event listener to the request that handles each row of data
  request.on("row", function (columns) {
    // Loop through each column and get its value
    columns.forEach(function (column) {
      quote = column.value;
    });
  });

  // Add an event listener to the request that handles the end of the query
  request.on("requestCompleted", function () {
    // Call the callback function with the quote
    callback(null, quote);
  });

  // Execute the request on the connection
  connection.execSql(request);
}

// Add a middleware to serve static files from the frontend folder
app.use(express.static("frontend"));

// Add a route handler for GET requests to /quote
app.get("/quote", function (req, res) {
  // Call the getQuote function and send the response
  getQuote(function (err, quote) {
    // If there is an error, send a status code of 500 and an error message
    if (err) {
      res.status(500).send("Something went wrong.");
    }
    // Otherwise, send a status code of 200 and a JSON object with the quote
    else {
      res.status(200).json({ quote: quote });
    }
  });
});

// Start the server and listen on the port number
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log("Server is running on port " + port);
});

And now how to easily populate this database with at least 15 Confucius quotes

<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT4</summary>
To populate the Azure SQL Database with at least 15 Confucius quotes, you can use the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio. For this example, I'll show you how to use Azure Data Studio.

Install Azure Data Studio if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website.

Open Azure Data Studio.

Click the "New Connection" icon (the plug icon) in the top left corner to create a new connection to your Azure SQL Database.

Fill in the connection details:

Server: Enter the server name you provided while creating the Azure SQL Database.
Authentication type: Choose "SQL Login."
User name: Enter the server admin login you provided while creating the Azure SQL Database.
Password: Enter the password you provided while creating the Azure SQL Database.
Database: Select your database from the dropdown.
Click "Connect" to establish the connection.

Once connected, right-click on your database name in the "Servers" tab on the left-hand side and select "New Query."

Copy and paste the following SQL script into the query editor:

```
CREATE TABLE Quotes (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    Text NVARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO Quotes (Text)
VALUES ('It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.'),
       ('Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.'),
       ('Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.'),
       ('He who learns but does not think is lost! He who thinks but does not learn is in great danger.'),
       ('To be wronged is nothing, unless you continue to remember it.'),
       ('The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.'),
       ('When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, don‚Äôt adjust the goals, adjust the action steps.'),
       ('Wherever you go, go with all your heart.'),
       ('The funniest people are the saddest once.'),
       ('The hardest thing of all is to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if there is no cat.'),
       ('Respect yourself and others will respect you.'),
       ('Ask yourself constantly, "What is the right thing to do?"'),
       ('When you are laboring for others, let it be with the same zeal as if it were for yourself.'),
       ('The superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions.'),
       ('To see what is right and not do it is the worst cowardice.');
  ```
Execute the script by clicking the "Run" button (the green triangle) at the top of the query editor.

After the script execution completes successfully, your "Quotes" table will be created, and it will contain 15 Confucius quotes.

You've now populated your Azure SQL Database with 15 Confucius quotes.




</details>
<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT3.5</summary>
Sure, here's one way to easily populate your SQL database with at least 15 Confucius quotes:

Create a new table in your SQL database to hold the quotes. For example:
```
CREATE TABLE quotes (
    id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    text NVARCHAR(MAX)
);
  ```
This will create a table with two columns: an auto-incrementing ID column and a column to hold the quote text.

Open a new query window in Azure Data Studio or SQL Server Management Studio.
Generate a list of Confucius quotes. You can find many lists of Confucius quotes online, such as this one: https://www.keepinspiring.me/confucius-quotes/
For each quote, write a SQL query to insert the quote into the quotes table. For example:
```
INSERT INTO quotes (text) VALUES ('It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.');
  ```
You can copy and paste this query for each quote, changing the quote text each time. Be sure to include the quotes around the text value.

Run each insert query in the query window to insert the quotes into the database.
Once you have completed these steps, your SQL database will be populated with at least 15 Confucius quotes. You can now proceed with connecting your front-end and back-end code to the database to retrieve and display the quotes on your website.

<summary>Bing AI Chat - Precise</summary>
To populate your Azure SQL database with Confucius quotes, you can use the Query editor in the Azure portal or use a tool such as SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to connect to your database and run SQL commands.

Here are the steps to populate your database with Confucius quotes using the Query editor in the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the left navigation pane, click on "SQL databases".
3. Click on the name of your database to open its overview page.
4. In the toolbar at the top of the page, click on "Query editor (preview)".
5. Sign in to the Query editor using your Azure SQL Database server admin credentials.
6. In the Query editor, you can write and execute SQL commands to create a table to store your quotes and insert data into it.

For example, you can create a table named `quotes` with two columns: `id` and `quote`. The `id` column is an integer that uniquely identifies each quote and the `quote` column is a string that contains the text of the quote.

Here is an example SQL command to create the `quotes` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE quotes (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  quote NVARCHAR(MAX)
);
```

You can then insert rows into the `quotes` table to add your Confucius quotes. Here is an example SQL command to insert a quote into the `quotes` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO quotes (id, quote)
VALUES (1, 'It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.');
```

You can repeat this command with different values for `id` and `quote` to insert more quotes into your table.

Is there anything else you would like to know about populating your Azure SQL database with Confucius quotes?

<summary>Bing AI Chat - Creative</summary>
Okay, I will try to help you with the seventh step. To populate your SQL database with Confucius quotes, you can use the Query editor in the Azure portal to run SQL queries against your database¬π. You can follow these steps:

- Sign in to the Azure portal.
- Select SQL databases from the left menu of the Azure portal. If SQL databases is not in the list, select All services, and then enter SQL databases in the search box.
- Select your database name (confucius-quotes-db) from the list of databases.
- Select Query editor (preview) from the left menu of your database page.
- On the sign-in screen, provide credentials to connect to the database. You can connect using SQL authentication or Azure AD. To connect with SQL authentication, under SQL server authentication, enter your server admin login and password that you created in the previous step, and then select OK.
- On the Query editor page, paste the following SQL query into the query editor. This query creates a table called quotes and inserts 15 Confucius quotes into it.

```
CREATE TABLE quotes (
  id INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  quote NVARCHAR(500) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO quotes (quote) VALUES
('The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.'),
('Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.'),
('It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.'),
('He who knows all the answers has not been asked all the questions.'),
('The journey with a 1000 miles begins with one step.'),
('Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.'),
('By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.'),
('Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.'),
('Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart.'),
('Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.'),
('To be wronged is nothing, unless you continue to remember it.'),
('When anger rises, think of the consequences.'),
('The more man meditates upon good thoughts, the better will be his world and the world at large.'),
('Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.'),
('What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.');
```

- Select Run to execute the query. After the query runs, the Messages pane displays Query succeeded: Affected rows: 16.

  ## 10.  
Do I have to modify any file from above after I did the SQL database?

<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT4</summary>
Yes, you need to modify the databaseConnection.js file in your backend to include the correct connection details for your newly created Azure SQL Database. Replace the placeholders in the config object with your actual Azure SQL Database connection details:

```
const config = {
    user: 'your_database_user', // Replace with your database username
    password: 'your_database_password', // Replace with your database password
    server: 'your_database_server', // Replace with your database server name
    database: 'your_database_name', // Replace with your database name
    options: {
        encrypt: true,
        enableArithAbort: true
    }
};
  ```
You can find these details in the Azure portal:

Sign in to the Azure portal.
Navigate to your SQL Database resource.
In the "Overview" tab, you will find the server name.
Click on the server name to navigate to the SQL server resource.
In the "Overview" tab of the SQL server resource, you will find the server admin login (username). Make sure you use the password you set when you created the SQL server.
After updating the databaseConnection.js file with the correct connection details, your backend will be able to connect to the Azure SQL Database and fetch random quotes from the "Quotes" table.




</details>
<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT3.5</summary>
Yes, after creating the SQL database, you will need to update the connection string in your back-end code (app.js) to include the necessary credentials and connection information for your database.

The exact steps to update the connection string will depend on the database service you are using (e.g. Azure SQL Database, SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, etc.) and the method you are using to connect to it (e.g. mssql package, pyodbc package, etc.).

Here's an example of what the connection string in app.js might look like using the mssql package:

```
const config = {
    user: 'your_username',
    password: 'your_password',
    server: 'your_server.database.windows.net',
    database: 'your_database_name',
    options: {
        encrypt: true,
        enableArithAbort: true,
    },
};

// Set up a connection pool to the database
const pool = await mssql.connect(config);
  ```
You will need to replace your_username, your_password, your_server, and your_database_name with the actual values for your SQL database.

Note that you should never hard-code sensitive information like passwords and connection strings directly in your code. Instead, you can store this information in environment variables or in a configuration file and read it into your code at runtime. This will help to protect your sensitive information from being exposed in your code repository.




</details>
<details>
<summary>Bing AI Chat - Precise</summary>
After creating and populating your Azure SQL database, you may need to modify your back-end code to connect to your database and fetch data from it.

In your back-end code, you can use a Node.js library such as `mssql` to connect to your Azure SQL database and run SQL commands to fetch data from it. You will need to provide the connection details for your database such as the server name, database name, and authentication credentials.

Here is an example of how you can use the `mssql` library to connect to your Azure SQL database and fetch a random quote from the `quotes` table:

```javascript
const sql = require('mssql');

const config = {
  user: '<your-database-username>',
  password: '<your-database-password>',
  server: '<your-database-server-name>',
  database: '<your-database-name>'
};

async function getRandomQuote() {
  try {
    await sql.connect(config);
    const result = await sql.query`SELECT TOP 1 quote FROM quotes ORDER BY NEWID()`;
    return result.recordset[0].quote;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}
```

This code uses the `mssql` library to connect to your Azure SQL database using the connection details provided in the `config` object. It then defines an asynchronous function named `getRandomQuote` that uses the `sql.query` method to run a SQL command that selects a random quote from the `quotes` table and returns it.

You can then call this function in your route handler for the `/quote` endpoint to fetch a random quote from your database and return it as a JSON response.

Is there anything else you would like to know about modifying your back-end code after creating your Azure SQL database?
</details>
<details>
<summary>Bing AI Chat - Creative</summary>
Yes, you may have to modify some files from above after you created the SQL database. For example, you may have to update the connection configuration for the SQL database in your backend/db.js file. You can use the connection strings that are provided in the Azure portal for your database. To find the connection strings, you can follow these steps:

- Sign in to the Azure portal.
- Select SQL databases from the left menu of the Azure portal. If SQL databases is not in the list, select All services, and then enter SQL databases in the search box.
- Select your database name (confucius-quotes-db) from the list of databases.
- Select Connection strings from the left menu of your database page.
- Copy the connection string for Node.js (tedious) and replace the placeholders with your server admin login and password.

For example, your connection string may look something like this:

```
Server=tcp:confucius-quotes-server.database.windows.net,1433;Authentication=Active Directory Password;Database=confucius-quotes-db;UID=azureuser;PWD=your_password;Encrypt=true;TrustServerCertificate=false;Connection Timeout=30;
```

You can use this connection string to update your config object in your backend/db.js file. For example, you can have something like this:

```
// Define the connection configuration for the SQL database
var config = {
  server: "confucius-quotes-server.database.windows.net",
  authentication: {
    type: "default",
    options: {
      userName: "azureuser",
      password: "your_password",
    },
  },
  options: {
    database: "confucius-quotes-db",
    encrypt: true,
  },
};
```

Okay, I will try to help you with the ninth step. To create a Web App in Azure portal with GitHub actions and App Insights, you can follow these steps¬π¬≤:

- Sign in to the Azure portal.
- Select Create a resource from the Azure portal menu, or from the Home page.
- In the Search box, enter Web App. From the results list, select Web App.
- On the Basics tab of the Create Web App form, under Project details, select your Azure subscription and the resource group that you created in the previous step.
- For Instance Details, enter a name for your web app, such as confucius-quotes-app. The web app name must be globally unique for all web apps in Azure, not just unique within a subscription. The portal lets you know if it's available or not.
- For Publish, select Code.
- For Runtime stack, select Node 14 LTS.
- For Operating System, select Linux.
- For Region, select a location from the dropdown list. It is recommended to use the same location as your resource group and your SQL database.
- Select Next: Monitoring at the bottom of the page.
- On the Monitoring tab, for Enable Application Insights, select Yes. This will create an Application Insights resource for your web app and enable monitoring features such as availability tests, performance monitoring, and alerts. You can also configure additional settings such as sampling percentage and retention period if you desire.
- Select Review + create at the bottom of the page.
- Review the values on the Summary page, and then select Create.

After your web app is created, you can configure GitHub actions to automate your deployment from GitHub to Azure¬≤¬≥. You can follow these steps:

- In GitHub, browse your repository that contains your node js app code. If you don't have one, you can create one and push your code to it.
- Select Settings > Security > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret. To use app-level credentials, paste the contents of the publish profile file that you downloaded in the previous step into the secret's value field. Name the secret AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE.
- Select Actions from your repository page. If you have an existing workflow file in your repository, you can edit it or create a new one. If you don't have any workflow file, you can choose a template or set up a workflow yourself.
- To set up a workflow yourself, select set up a workflow yourself. This will create a new workflow file with some default content. You can edit this file to suit your needs. For example, you can have something like this:

```
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI/CD

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This job deploys your node js app to Azure Web App
  deploy:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      # Sets up Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js environment
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14.x'
      
      # Installs dependencies and builds your app
      - name: npm install and build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build --if-present
      
      # Deploys your app to Azure Web App using publish profile
      - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: 'confucius-quotes-app'
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
          package: .
```

- Select Start commit to commit your workflow file to your repository. This will trigger your workflow to run and deploy your app to Azure Web App.

  ## 12.  
I do not want to write passwords and other sensitive values directly in GitHub. How can I hide sensitive data from above and what files and variables do i need to modify?

<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT4</summary>
To hide sensitive data, you can use environment variables and GitHub Secrets. In the previous response, I already showed you how to use GitHub Secrets for your AZURE_CREDENTIALS and AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE.

Now, let's set up environment variables to hide sensitive data in the databaseConnection.js file.

In the databaseConnection.js file, update the config object to read the connection details from environment variables:
```
const config = {
    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
    server: process.env.DB_SERVER,
    database: process.env.DB_NAME,
    options: {
        encrypt: true,
        enableArithAbort: true
    }
};
  ```
Create a .env file in the root of your backend folder to store your local environment variables:
```
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_SERVER=your_database_server
DB_NAME=your_database_name
  ```
Install the dotenv package to load the environment variables from the .env file:
bash
Copy code
npm install dotenv
In your index.js file (or the main entry point of your backend), add the following line at the very beginning to load the environment variables:
javascript
Copy code
require('dotenv').config();
Add the .env file to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to your GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
.env
Configure GitHub Actions to use the environment variables during deployment. Update the 'Deploy to Azure Web App' step in your GitHub Actions workflow YAML file:
```
- name: 'Deploy to Azure Web App'
  uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
  with:
    app-name: <your_azure_webapp_name>
    publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
    package: .
  env:
    DB_USER: ${{ secrets.DB_USER }}
    DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
    DB_SERVER: ${{ secrets.DB_SERVER }}
    DB_NAME: ${{ secrets.DB_NAME }}
  ```
Store the database connection details as GitHub Secrets:

a. Go to your GitHub repository's "Settings" tab.
b. Click on "Secrets" in the left sidebar.
c. Click on "New repository secret."
d. Add the following secrets: DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_SERVER, and DB_NAME, with their respective values.

Now, your sensitive data is hidden from your GitHub repository and securely stored in environment variables and GitHub Secrets.




</details>
<details>
<summary>ChatGPT - GPT3.5</summary>
To avoid exposing sensitive data like passwords and connection strings directly in your GitHub repository, you can use GitHub Secrets to securely store and retrieve this information at runtime. GitHub Secrets are encrypted environment variables that can be accessed by your GitHub Actions workflows and are not visible to anyone with access to your GitHub repository.

Here's how to use GitHub Secrets to store and access sensitive data for your project:

In your GitHub repository, go to "Settings" and click on "Secrets" in the left-hand menu.
Click on the "New repository secret" button to create a new secret.
Enter a name for the secret and the value of the secret (e.g. your SQL database password).
Click "Add secret" to save the secret.
Now that you have added the secret, you can reference it in your GitHub Actions workflows using the ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }} syntax, where "SECRET_NAME" is the name of the secret you created.

For example, you can update your app.js file to use the following code to read the SQL database password from a GitHub Secret:

```
const config = {
    user: 'your_username',
    password: process.env.SQL_DB_PASSWORD,
    server: 'your_server.database.windows.net',
    database: 'your_database_name',
    options: {
        encrypt: true,
        enableArithAbort: true,
    },
};

// Set up a connection pool to the database
const pool = await mssql.connect(config);
  ```
Note that we are using process.env.SQL_DB_PASSWORD to reference the SQL database password as an environment variable. This environment variable is set by GitHub Actions at runtime and retrieves its value from the corresponding GitHub Secret.

You can use this approach to store and retrieve other sensitive information like API keys, access tokens, and other configuration values that should not be publicly exposed in your code repository.

<details>
<summary>Bing AI Chat - Precise</summary>
It's a good practice to avoid storing sensitive data such as passwords and connection strings directly in your GitHub repository. Instead, you can use environment variables to store this data and access it in your code.

In your Node.js app, you can use the `process.env` object to access the values of environment variables. For example, if you have an environment variable named `DB_PASSWORD` that stores the password for your Azure SQL database, you can access its value in your code like this:

```javascript
const dbPassword = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
```

To set the value of an environment variable in your local development environment, you can create a `.env` file in the root of your project folder and add your environment variables to it. For example:

```
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
```

Make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file so that it is not committed to your GitHub repository.

In your Azure Web App, you can set the values of environment variables using the Application Settings feature. Here are the steps to set an environment variable in your Azure Web App:

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Web App's overview page.
2. In the left navigation pane, click on "Configuration" under the "Settings" section.
3. Click on the "Application settings" tab.
4. Click on the "New application setting" button and enter the name and value of your environment variable.
5. Click on the "OK" button to save your changes.

After setting the value of your environment variable in your Azure Web App, you can access its value in your code using the `process.env` object just like in your local development environment.

Is there anything else you would like to know about hiding sensitive data in your GitHub repository and using environment variables?

I understand that you do not want to write passwords and other sensitive values directly in GitHub. You can hide sensitive data by using GitHub secrets and environment variables. GitHub secrets are encrypted values that you can store in your repository settings and use in your workflow files. Environment variables are values that you can set in your workflow files and use in your code. For example, you can follow these steps:

- In GitHub, browse your repository that contains your node js app code.
- Select Settings > Security > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret. To use app-level credentials, paste the contents of the publish profile file that you downloaded in the previous step into the secret's value field. Name the secret AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE. This will hide your publish profile credentials from your workflow file.
- In your workflow file, use the secret as an input to the azure/webapps-deploy action. For example, you can have something like this:

```
      - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: 'confucius-quotes-app'
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
          package: .
```

- In your backend/db.js file, use environment variables to store your SQL database credentials. For example, you can have something like this:

```
// Define the connection configuration for the SQL database
var config = {
  server: process.env.SQL_SERVER_NAME,
  authentication: {
    type: "default",
    options: {
      userName: process.env.SQL_USER_NAME,
      password: process.env.SQL_PASSWORD,
    },
  },
  options: {
    database: process.env.SQL_DATABASE_NAME,
    encrypt: true,
  },
};
```

- In your workflow file, use the env keyword to set the environment variables for your SQL database credentials. For example, you can have something like this:

```
env:
  SQL_SERVER_NAME: 'confucius-quotes-server.database.windows.net'
  SQL_USER_NAME: 'azureuser'
  SQL_PASSWORD: 'your_password'
  SQL_DATABASE_NAME: 'confucius-quotes-db'
```
