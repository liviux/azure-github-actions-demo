### How to use AI from OpenAI to solve some DevOps problems.  
I found a job interview task that and it requierments are basicly  

Use a free account on Azure and GitHub and implement a basic deployment pipeline using GitHub actions to create an Azure resource group and provision a Web App, a SQL Database, one AutoScale settings, at least one Alert rules, and monitoring (App Insights). Web App backend must be able to use that SQL database. Deploy a simple Web App to this infrastructure from the pipeline (can be just a static html page)

Implement a basic pipeline using Github Actions and Azure.
Inside an Azure resource group there should be 
- a Web App
- a SQL Database
- one Autoscale setting
- at least one Alert rule
- monitoring with App Insights  
The web app should be a simple static landing page with one backround and beautiful CSS. The page will have be a single button that when pushed will change the text on the centre-middle of the page. The text is from the SQL database and is populated with Confucius quotes.
