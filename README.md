Implement a basic pipeline using Github Actions and Azure.
Inside an Azure resource group there should be 
- a Web App
- a SQL Database
- one Autoscale setting
- at least one Alert rule
- monitoring with App Insights
The web app should be a simple static landing page with one backround and beautiful CSS. The page will have be a single button that when pushed will change the text on the centre-middle of the page. The text is from the SQL database and is populated with Confucius quotes.
